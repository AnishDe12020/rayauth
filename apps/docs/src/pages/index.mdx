# RayAuth

Users have to install a wallet, store their private key securely and buy SOL to pay gas before performing any transaction on a dApp. This is too much friction for a normal user.

RayAuth provide users with a non-custodial social-login enabled web-based Solana wallet along with other features like gasless transactions and account delegation.
