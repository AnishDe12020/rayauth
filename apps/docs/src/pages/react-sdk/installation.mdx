# Installation

To create a React application with @rayauth/react, you have the option to use one of three popular tools: Create React App (CRA), Vite, or Next.js. To run @rayauth/react, it's important to have the latest LTS version of Node installed on your system.
`@rayauth/react` is a library that provides an authentication provider for React applications. The RayAuthProvider component is used to wrap the main application component and provide authentication functionality.


## Setup

Installation

To install @rayauth/react, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @rayauth/react

pnpm install @rayauth/react

yarn add @rayauth/react
```


## Usage

To use @rayauth/react, first import the RayAuthProvider component from the library:

```js
import { RayAuthProvider } from "@rayauth/react";
```

Next, wrap your main application component with the RayAuthProvider component, passing in the required config object:

```javascript
<React.StrictMode>
  <RayAuthProvider
    config={{
      clientId: "test",
      callbackUrl: "http://localhost:5173",
      provider: providers.google,
      cookieName: "cookieName"
    }}
  >
    <App />
  </RayAuthProvider>
</React.StrictMode>
```

#### The config object must contain the following properties:

`clientId`: The client ID for your Ray authentication application.
`callbackUrl`: The callback URL to redirect to after authentication.
`provider`: The authentication provider to use (e.g. Google, Facebook, etc.).
`cookieName`: The name of the cookie to use for authentication.

#### Configuring the Provider

The RayAuthProvider component takes a config object as a prop, which must include the properties mentioned above. Here's what each of them means:

`clientId`: Your Ray authentication client ID, which you can obtain from the Ray authentication dashboard.

`callbackUrl`: The URL that Ray should redirect the user to after authentication is complete. This URL must be listed as an authorized redirect URI in your Ray authentication dashboard.

`provider`: The authentication provider to use. This can be one of the following values from the providers enum:
providers.google
providers.discord
providers.github

`cookieName`: The name of the cookie that will be set upon successful authentication.


#### Using the Provider

Once you've configured the provider, you can use the provider in root of your project.

##### Example

```ts 
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { RayAuthProvider, providers } from "@rayauth/react";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root") as HTMLElement).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <RayAuthProvider
      config={{
        clientId: "63fc80e8da0cb8775e46fc73",
        callbackUrl: "http://localhost:5173",
        provider: providers.google,
        cookieName: "cookieName"
      }}
    >
      <App />
    </RayAuthProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
